## Appendix

Every year lakhs of junior college students pass their H.S.C and enter engineering colleges. While going through admission procedure student need to enter some minimum count of colleges in which he might have a chance to get admission. Because of this a candidate needs to prepare a list of colleges in which he/she intends to get admission. This task of list generation requires a large amount of manually searching, comparing different prospects of colleges.

Goal of this project was to automate this college list generation. Aim was to reduce all this manual working by making a system which can effectively and efficiently generate a list of colleges in which candidate is eligible based on official database provided by government. Recommendation systems solve the problem of "Information Overload" of searching through large volumes of data.
